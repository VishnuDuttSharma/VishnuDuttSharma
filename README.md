### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**VishnuDuttSharma/VishnuDuttSharma** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on interpretable/explainable Deep Learning + Robotic perception and planning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the depth and breadth of the above areas.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project on robotic decision-making and their explanations. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how deep learning models work and what are their limitations.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me or DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VishnuDSharma) 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/hom
- âš¡ Fun fact: You can get one such summary too -- just create a GitHub repo with the name exactly matching your username, and anything you write in the repo's README will show up here.
